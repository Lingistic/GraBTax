# GraBTax
Graph-based, query-dependent taxonomy generation library

GraBTax (Graph-based Automatic Taxonomy Generation) is a query-dependent taxonomy 
generation approach proposed in (Treeratpituk et al., 2013), for constructing query-dependent taxonomies from a weighted graph representing 
topic associations present within a text corpus. A graph partitioning algorithm is used to recursively partition the topic graph 
into taxonomies, and partition labels are selected based on network centrality within partitioned subgraphs (Treeratpituk et al., 2013).
  
This library is implemented using the multilevel graph partitioning scheme discussed in 
(Karpis and Kumar, 1999), and implemented in [METIS](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview) (redistributed in this repo under the original Apache 2.0 license). Additionally, [METIS for Python](https://metis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is used 
to wrap the METIS library, which is licensed by [Ken Watford](https://bitbucket.org/kw/) under MIT and also redistributed here.
